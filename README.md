If the project is completed as intended, it will be capable of actively scraping data from Amazon and displaying it on-demand. This means that users will be able to request specific information from the Amazon website, and the project will utilize web scraping techniques to extract the relevant data in real-time.

By scraping data from Amazon, the project can gather various details such as product information, prices, reviews, availability, and more. This data can then be displayed within the application, providing users with the ability to access and analyze Amazon's information without directly visiting the website.

By incorporating web scraping capabilities, this project aims to offer users the convenience of accessing Amazon's data on-demand, facilitating easy browsing, comparison, and analysis of products or information available on the platform.
